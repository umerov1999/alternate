# About
**Alternate** - new alternative version of vk. We provide different useful functions, like offline, do not mark dialog as read, hidden message typing, music downloading etc

# Why do I have to enter my login and password?
We have to do that, because of VK API limits. We use authorization via official vk apps, like vk for android or kate mobile. If don't trust us anyway, you can use demo-version. You authorize via vk.com, but the most of **Alternate's** functions won't be available.
